<h1>The World of Anime</h1>
<h2>The History of Anime</h2>
<p>I'm actually just trolling. I really don't know anything about history of anime. So, I call GG's on that aspect.<br/>
But, there are some, if not many, animes that I really like and find entertaining.<br/>
I'm going to list out some of those animes down here for you so that you can check thme out for yourself whenever you want.</p>

<p>This is a romantic anime. Romantic shows are not actually my thing most times. But this anime, in my opinion, is actually very interesting, and I recommend this anime to all those who like to watch animes</p>

<p>See now, when you talk about peak and fire animes in terms of intelligence and high iq interactions, activities and challenges, this one has to be in the top 10. The name of the MC (Main Character) of this anime is: Kiyotaka Ayanokoji. The anime circulates the art of high intellignce-based challenges and a very good storyline to keep you at the edge of your seat. This show is very much entertaining and interesting. I give this a 10 out of 10</p>

<p>This another "somehow" romantic anime that is really good and entertaining. I would just summarize is as an anime which starts off as the main character being an introverted, low self-esteemed individual who likes making and dressing up dolls. He thinks this hobby makes him an outcast from society and he always keeps to himslef, until he is caught in his school Home Ec. room sewing clothes for his dolls to wear by the most popular and most liked girl in his class: Kitagawa. It turns out that she likes sewing clothes as well, but she does that because she likes to cosplay and she's really bad at it. So, the main character: Gojo keeps on helping her with making for her cosplays and their social and personal lives progress from there on.üëç</p>
